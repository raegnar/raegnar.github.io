Been meaning to write about this for a while.

This is a handy trick I learned while I was at Intel working with CEAN (C/C++ Extensions to Array Notation), which I believe is now called "Array Notation" and a part of their <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-array-building-blocks/">Array Building Blocks (ArBB)</a> product, or <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-parallel-building-blocks/">Parallel Building Blocks</a>,  not sure, their current marketing and packaging is fairly indecipherable.

Anyway, "Array Notation" allows operations  on array regions in a pretty straightforward manner.  I won't get into how it works since its not relevant here, but for the curious there is more information <a href="http://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/composerxe/en-us/cpp/mac/optaps/common/optaps_par_cean_prog.htm">here</a>.

The problem is that the access patterns it allows is somewhat limited.  Especially when the arrays are actually representing multi-dimensional data.

Assuming you have an array defined as

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
float *array_1D[XRES*YRES*ZRES];
[/sourcecode]

you can actually convert that to a multi-dimensional array using a syntax similar to function pointer syntax.

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
float (*array_3D)[YRES][XRES] = (float (*)[YRES][XRES])array_1D;
[/sourcecode]

Trying to decipher this using the "<a href="http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html">Clockwise/Spiral Rule</a>" tells us that
array_3D is an array of pointers to two-dimensional arrays

This is going to allow you to avoid the index calculation in a typical access pattern.

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
for(int z = 1; z &lt; ZRES - 1; z++)
for(int y = 1; y &lt; YRES - 1; y++)
for(int x = 1; x &lt; XRES - 1; x++)
{
	int index = x + y*XRES + z*XRES*YRES;
	a_1D[index] = b_1D[index] + c_1D[index];
}
[/sourcecode]

And instead write it

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
for(int z = 1; z &lt; ZRES - 1; z++)
for(int y = 1; y &lt; YRES - 1; y++)
for(int x = 1; x &lt; XRES - 1; x++)
{
	a_3D[z][y][x] = b_3D[z][y][x] + c_3D[z][y][x];
}
[/sourcecode]

For the curious the above loops were chosen because they operate only on the interior elements of an array, that is, they avoid all edge elements.  This demonstrate the utility of casting for array notation, because there is no way to represent this access pattern on a typical array in array notation without casting.  With casting it would look like this

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
a_3D[1:ZRES-2][1:YRES-2][1:XRES-2] = b_3D[1:ZRES-2][1:YRES-2][1:XRES-2] +
                                     c_3D[1:ZRES-2][1:YRES-2][1:XRES-2];
[/sourcecode]
<h1>Variable Length Arrays</h1>
Of course, all array length variables must be defined at compile time, otherwise this trick won't work. Unless your compiler has VLA (variable length array) support,
<h1>The Union Trick</h1>
A nice way to get the best of both worlds is to define your arrays inside a Union type

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
union Array
{

}
[/sourcecode]
