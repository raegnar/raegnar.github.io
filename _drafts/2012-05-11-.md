void glBindTransformFeedback(	GLenum  	target,
 	GLuint  	id);

Too many enums!!!  There is only one valid target for glBindTransformFeedback, and that is GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK, which seems horribly redundant.  Really?  I'm using glBindTransformFeedback for transform feedback?  Who would have thought?

I realize they could potentially add other target, but I would rather they just add another function.

glBindSomethingElse(something_else_id);

seems so much more sensible than glBindTransformFeedback(GL_SOMETHING_ELSE, something_else_id);



Too much state!!!

Instead of having to bind transformFeedback before I begin transformFeedback

glBindTransformFeedback(GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK, transform_feedback_id);
glBeginTransformFeedback(GL_LINES);

Get rid of the pointless enum and pass the id to the begin function

glBeginTransformFeedback(transform_feedback_id, GL_LINES);

And better yet get rid of the last enum


glBeginTransformFeedbackLines(transform_feedback_id);
