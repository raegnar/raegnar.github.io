Another nice collections of links and papers too valuable to lose among all my bookmarks. Â This time on physically-based rendering, put together by Kostas Anagnostou (<a href="https://twitter.com/thinkinggamer">@thinkinggamer</a>).

List maintained and updated over at his blog <a href="http://interplayoflight.wordpress.com/">Interplay of Light</a>:
