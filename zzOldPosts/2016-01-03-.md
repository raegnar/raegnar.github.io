I've recently developed an interest in Texture Space Shading, mostly, because I've heard various people mention it at conferences, and always without ever describing what it is.

It's generally discussed in relation to normal-map filtering.  The first thing that comes up when you google it is

<a href="http://www.selfshadow.com/talks/rock_solid_shading_v1.pdf">Rock Solid Shading: Image Stability Without Sacrificing Detail</a> by Dan Baker and Stephen Hill

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Which then references

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mobius.cn/advanced-lighting-techniques-dan-baker-meltdown-2005">Advanced Lighting Techniques</a> by Dan Baker in 2005, which finally describes what it actually is around slide 42.
